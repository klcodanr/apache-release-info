  "description": "Deltacloud contains a cloud abstraction API - whether the Deltacloud classic API, the DMTF CIMI API or even the EC2 API. Each abstraction API works as a wrapper around a large number of clouds, shielding users from their differences. For every cloud provider there is a driver \"speaking\" that cloud provider's native API, freeing you from dealing with the particulars of each cloud's API.",
