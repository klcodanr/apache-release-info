  "description": "<h3><a name=\"WelcomeToApacheProvisionr\"></a>Welcome to Apache Provisionr (incubating)</h3>\n\n<p>Provisionr is an effort to develop a service that can be used to create and manage pools of virtual machines on multiple clouds. Our focus is on semi-automated workflows, cloud portability and on providing a robust foundation for configuration and higher level management.</p>\n\n<h4><a name=\"Objectives\"></a>Objectives</h4>\n\n<p>Provisionr solves the problem of cloud portability by hiding completely the APIs and only focusing on building a cluster that matches the same set of assumptions on all clouds, assumptions like: a specific OS,  pre-installed packages and binaries, sane dns settings, ssh & vpn access etc. - think a solid foundation for configuration.</p>\n\n<p>As a secondary goal Provisionr will also provide primitives for building automatic or semi-automatic workflows for configuring and monitoring services, workflows that assume that all the machines share a common set of characteristics as described above.</p>\n\n<h4><a name=\"StayInTouch\"></a>How to stay in touch?</h4>\n\n<p>Right now the best way is to subscribe to the development mailing list by sending <br />an email to <a href=\"mailto:dev-subscribe@provisionr.incubator.apache.org\">dev-subscribe@provisionr.incubator.apache.org</a>.</p>\n\n<h4><a name=\"GetTheCode\"></a>How to get the code?</h4>\n\n<p>\n<code>git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-provisionr.git</code></p>\n<br />",
