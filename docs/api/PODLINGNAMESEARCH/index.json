  "description": "<p>A suitable name search must be completed before a podling can graduate. The name proposed when the podling enters the Incubator is provisional. So, it's in the best interests of the community to complete this task ideally as soon as possible after entering the Incubator.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe suitable name search comprises public and private elements. This JIRA records facts and actions. Interpretation and analysis of these facts needs to be reserved for private lists. \r\n</p><p>\r\nPlease avoid using loaded technical legal terms. Use plain, simple English to describe what you did and what you found. Avoid speculation.\r\n</p>",
