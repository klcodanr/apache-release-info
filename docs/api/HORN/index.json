  "description": "The Apache Horn is an Apache Incubating project, a neuron-centric programming model and Sync and Async hybrid distributed training framework, supports both data and model parallelism for training large models with massive datasets. Unlike most systems having matrix approach to neural network training, Horn adopted the the neuron-centric model which enables training large-scale deep learning on highly scalable CPU cluster. In the future, we plan also to support GPU accelerations for heterogeneous devices.",
