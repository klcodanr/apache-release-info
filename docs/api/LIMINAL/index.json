  "description": "Apache Liminal is an end-to-end platform for data engineers & scientists, allowing them to build, train and deploy machine learning models in a robust and agile way. The platform provides the abstractions and declarative capabilities for data extraction & feature engineering followed by model training and serving. Apache Liminal's goal is to operationalise the machine learning process, allowing data scientists to quickly transition from a successful experiment to an automated pipeline of model training, validation, deployment and inference in production, freeing them from engineering and non-functional tasks, and allowing them to focus on machine learning code and artifacts.",
