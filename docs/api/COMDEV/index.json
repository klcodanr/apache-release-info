Our aim here is to help newcomers to The Apache Software Foundation take their first steps on their way to being a part of our community. We do not focus on any specific projects here, we focus on the common structures and processes you will find in the majority of ASF projects. Our goal is to help you understand how the ASF works and give you the confidence to participate more directly.",
